Title "Intersection distributes over union"

Introduction
"
This proof is longer than previous ones, but it doesn't require any new tactics or theorems.
Just stick with it and keep applying the ideas from previous levels!

TheoremTab "∩∪"

/-- For any sets `A`, `B`, and `C`, `inter_distrib_left A B C` is a proof of the
statement `A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C)`.  In Mathlib, the name of this theorem
is `Set.inter_distrib_left`. -/
TheoremDoc STG4.inter_distrib_left as "inter_distrib_left" in "∩∪"

/-- For any sets $A$, $B$, and $C$, $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$. -/
Statement inter_distrib_left (A B C : Set U) : A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C) := by
  Hint "Once again, Lean has left out some parentheses that it regards as unnecessary.
  Lean gives intersection higher precedence than union, so it interprets
  `A ∩ B ∪ A ∩ C` as `(A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C)`."

  Hint (strict := true) (hidden := true) "It may help you see how to proceed if you separate
  out the second half of `{h}` as a separate assumption.
  You can do this with `have {h}BC : {x} ∈ B ∪ C := {h}.right`."
