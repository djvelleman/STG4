World "Complement"
Title "Complement World"

Introduction
"If `A` is a set of objects from the universe `U`, then the *complement* of `A`,
denoted `Aᶜ`, is the set of all objects in the universe `U` that are *not*
elements of `A`.

For example, if `U` consists of all people and `A` is the set of people who are more than
6 feet tall, then `Aᶜ` is the set of all people who are at most 6 feet tall.

In this world, we'll see how to prove theorems about complements.
