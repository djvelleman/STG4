World "Complement"
Level 5
Title "Complement subsets equivalence"

Introduction
"
In this last level of Complement World, you'll prove a statement of the form `P ↔ Q`.  The most
useful theorem for this purpose is `Iff.intro`.  If you have `h1 : P → Q` and `h2 : Q → P`, then
`Iff.intro h1 h2` is a proof of `P ↔ Q`.  As we saw in the last level, that means you can start your
proof with `apply Iff.intro`.  Lean will set `P → Q` and `Q → P` as the goals that are needed
to complete the proof.

Statement (A B : Set U) : A ⊆ B ↔ Bᶜ ⊆ Aᶜ := by
  Hint "For the proof in this level, `apply Iff.intro` will create the goals `A ⊆ B → Bᶜ ⊆ Aᶜ`
  and `Bᶜ ⊆ Aᶜ → A ⊆ B`."
  apply Iff.intro
  Hint (hidden := true) "Of course, you should begin by introducing the assumption
  `h1 : A ⊆ B`."
  intro h1
  Hint "Fortunately, the theorem `compl_subset_compl_of_subset` can now be used to prove the goal.
  (Click on `compl_subset_compl_of_subset` in the list of theorems on the right if you don't
  remember what the theorem says.)"
  Hint (hidden := true) "`compl_subset_compl_of_subset {h1}` will prove the goal."
  exact compl_subset_compl_of_subset h1
  Hint "The second goal is similar, but a little trickier."
  intro h1
  Hint (strict := true) "The theorem `compl_subset_compl_of_subset {h1}` doesn't prove the goal,
  but it comes close.  Do you see what assertion it will justify?"
  Hint (strict := true) (hidden := true) "You can use `compl_subset_compl_of_subset {h1}` to
  justify the assertion `Aᶜᶜ ⊆ Bᶜᶜ`."
  have h2 : Aᶜᶜ ⊆ Bᶜᶜ := compl_subset_compl_of_subset h1
  Hint (strict := true) "Fortunately, we can use the theorem `compl_compl` to prove `Aᶜᶜ = A` and
  `Bᶜᶜ = B`, and those statements should get us from `{h2}` to the goal.
  We have seen in previous levels that the `rewrite` tactic can be applied to a proof of a
  statement of the form `P ↔ Q` to replace `P` with `Q`.  The tactic can also be applied to
  equations: if `t` is a proof of an equation `p = q`, then `rewrite [t]` will
  replace `p` with `q`."
  Hint (strict := true) (hidden := true) "`rewrite [compl_compl A] at {h2}` will change `Aᶜᶜ` to
  `A`, and `rewrite [compl_compl B] at {h2}` will change `Bᶜᶜ` to `B`.  In fact, you can do both
  rewrites in one step:  `rewrite [compl_compl A, compl_compl B] at {h2}`."
  rewrite [compl_compl A, compl_compl B] at h2
  exact h2

NewHiddenTactic constructor

Conclusion
"
The proof in this level illustrates how previously proven theorems can be used in proofs.

There is another tactic you can use if your goal has the form `P ↔ Q`.  In this situation,
the tactic `constructor` will have the same effect as `apply Iff.intro`; that is, it will
set `P → Q` and `Q → P` as goals to be proven.
