Level 1
Title "Complement of a family union"

Introduction
"
In this level you'll prove a generalization of the theorem `compl_union` that you proved
in Combination World.  That theorem was about the complement of a union of two sets; the
theorem in this level is about the complement of a union of a family of sets.

As in the case of `compl_union`, you have a choice about how to deal with the negations that
arise when you write out the meaning of complement.  You can use the `push_neg` tactic to
reexpress negative statements, or you can use proof by contradiction.

    Hint "Since `{h1}` is a negative statement, a good way to reach a contradiction
    would be to contradict it.  In other words, `{h1} _` would prove the goal `False` if you can
    fill in the blank with a proof of `{x} ∈ ⋃₀ F`.  That means the tactic `apply {h1}` will
    set your goal to be `{x} ∈ ⋃₀ F`."

    and Lean will set `{t}ᶜ ∈ \{s | sᶜ ∈ F}` as your immediate goal.  Once you achieve that goal,
    Lean will add `{h2}a : {t}ᶜ ∈ \{s | sᶜ ∈ F}` to your list of assumptions, and you can continue
    with the proof of your original goal.  For further details, click on `have` in the list of tactics
