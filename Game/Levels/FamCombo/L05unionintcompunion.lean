Title "A union intersected with the complement of another is a subset"

Introduction
"
What happens if you intersect `⋃₀ F` with `(⋃₀ G)ᶜ`, for two families `F` and `G`?
"

/-- Suppose $F$ and $G$ are families of sets.  Then $(\bigcup F) \cap (\bigcup G)^c \subseteq
\bigcup (F \cap G^c)$.-/
Statement (F G : Set (Set U)) : (⋃₀ F) ∩ (⋃₀ G)ᶜ ⊆ ⋃₀ (F ∩ Gᶜ) := by
