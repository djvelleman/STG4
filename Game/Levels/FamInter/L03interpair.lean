World "FamInter"
Level 3
Title "Intersection of a pair"

Introduction
"
This level shows that family intersections are a generalization of the intersections
we studied in Intersection World.  You'll prove that if `A` and `B` are sets, then
`A ∩ B` is equal to the intersection of the family of sets that contains just `A` and
`B` and nothing else.

We'll need notation for the family of sets consisting of just `A` and `B`; we'll denote
this family by `{A, B}`.  And, as usual, we'll need a theorem stating the definition of
this notation.  For any `t`, `A`, and `B`, `mem_pair t A B` is a proof of the
statement `t ∈ {A, B} ↔ t = A ∨ t = B`.
