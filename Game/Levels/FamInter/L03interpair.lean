Title "Intersection of a pair"

Introduction
"
This level shows that family intersections are a generalization of the intersections
we studied in Intersection World.  You'll prove that if `A` and `B` are sets, then
`A ∩ B` is equal to the intersection of the family of sets that contains just `A` and
`B` and nothing else.

We'll need notation for the family of sets consisting of just `A` and `B`; we'll denote
this family by `{A, B}`.  And, as usual, we'll need a theorem stating the definition of
this notation.  For any `t`, `A`, and `B`, `mem_pair t A B` is a proof of the
statement `t ∈ {A, B} ↔ t = A ∨ t = B`.

/--
If `a` denotes some object, then `{a}` denotes the set whose only element is `a`; such a set
is called a *singleton* set.  Similarly, if `a` and `b` denote objects, then `{a, b}` denotes
the set whose elements are `a` and `b`, and nothing else.  (Similar notation can be used to
denote a set containing any finite list of objects.  All of the objects in the list must
have the same type; if the objects have type `U`, then the set has type `Set U`.)

There is another way to define sets.  If `P x` is a statement about an
unspecified object `x`, then `{x | P x}` denotes the set of all values of `x` that make `P x`
come out true.  This is often called *set-builder notation*.
