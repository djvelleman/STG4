World "FamUnion"
Level 4
Title "Union of a pair"

Introduction
"
In this level, you'll show that, as with intersections, family unions generalize the
unions we studied in Union World.

/-- Suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets.  Then $A \cup B = \bigcup \{A, B\}$. -/
Statement (A B : Set U) : A ∪ B = ⋃₀ {A, B}:= by

  Hint "Remember, you can use `obtain` to introduce a name for the set that is asserted to
  exist in `{h1}`."
