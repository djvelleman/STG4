Title "Union subset of a set"

Introduction
"
Suppose `A` is a set and `F` is a family of sets.  In this level you'll determine the conditions
under which `⋃₀ F` is a subset of `A`.

/-- Suppose $A$ is a set and $F$ is a family of sets.  Then $\bigcup F$ is a subset of $A$
if and only if every element of $F$ is a subset of $A$. -/

  Hint (hidden := true) "Notice that `{h1}` could be applied to a proof of `{x} ∈ ⋃₀ F` to
  prove the goal.  That means that `apply {h1}` will set `{x} ∈ ⋃₀ F` as the goal."
