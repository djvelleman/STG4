Introduction
"
To work with intersections, we'll need to understand the word \"and\".

If `P` and `Q` are statements, then `P ∧ Q` means \"P and Q\".  To enter the
symbol `∧`, type `\\and`.  For the statement `P ∧ Q` to be true, `P` and `Q` must
both be true.  If you have `h : P ∧ Q`--that is, `h` is a proof of
the statement `P ∧ Q`--then in Lean, `h.left` is a proof of `P` and `h.right` is
a proof of `Q`.  That should be all you need to know to solve this level.

/-- `P ∧ Q` means "P and Q".  To enter the symbol `∧`, type `\and`.

### If your goal is `P ∧ Q`

If you have `hP : P` and `hQ : Q`, then `And.intro hP hQ` is a proof of `P ∧ Q`,
so `exact And.intro hP hQ` will close the goal.
If you don't yet have proofs of `P` and `Q`, then `apply And.intro` will set `P` and `Q`
as separate goals.  In this situation, the tactic `constructor` has the same effect as
`apply And.intro`.

### If you have an assumption `h : P ∧ Q`

Lean will recognize `h.left` as a proof of `P` and `h.right` as a proof of `Q`.
