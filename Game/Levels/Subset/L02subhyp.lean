Title "A subset hypothesis"

Introduction
"
If `A` and `B` are sets, then we say that `A` is a *subset* of `B` if
every element of `A` is also an element of `B`.  The notation `A ⊆ B` means
that `A` is a subset of `B`.  (To enter the symbol `⊆`, type `\\sub`,
followed by a space.)

If you have `h1 : A ⊆ B`, then `h1` is a proof that, if something is an element
of `A`, then it is also an element of `B`.  Thus, if you also have `h2 : x ∈ A`,
then you can apply `h1` to `h2` to conclude that `x ∈ B`.  To apply `h1` to `h2`,
you simply write `h1` followed by `h2`, with a space between them.  Thus, in
this situation, `h1 h2` is a proof of `x ∈ B`.

  close the goal with `exact h1 h2`."
  exact h1 h2

Conclusion
"
This example is a better illustration of how the `exact` tactic is usually
used.  Often `exact` is followed by an expression that combines assumptions
to prove the goal.  In later levels, we will see other ways in which
assumptions can be combined to prove a goal.

Note that in this proof, `h1` could be thought of as a function that can be
applied to a proof of any statement of the form `x ∈ A` to produce a proof
of `x ∈ B`.  Many proofs in Lean behave like functions.
