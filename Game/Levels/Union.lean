World "Union"
Title "Union World"

Introduction
"If `A` and `B` are sets, then the *union* of `A` and `B`, denoted
`A ∪ B`, is the set you get by throwing all the elements of `A` and `B`
together into one set.  In other words, for an object to be an element of
`A ∪ B`, it must be an element of either `A` or `B`, or both.

For example, if `A` is the set of all people under 30, and `B` is the set of
all people over 20, then `A ∪ B` is the set of all people.

In this world you'll prove some basic properties of unions of sets.
