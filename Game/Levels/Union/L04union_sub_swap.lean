World "Union"
Level 4
Title "Union subset of swap"

Introduction
"
In the next level we're going to prove that union is commutative; that is,
`A ∪ B = B ∪ A`.  We're going to imitate the approach we used in Intersection World
to prove that intersection is commutative.  We begin by proving `A ∪ B ⊆ B ∪ A`.

TheoremTab "∩∪"

/-- For any sets `A` and `B`, `union_sub_swap A B` is a proof of
`A ∪ B ⊆ B ∪ A`. -/

/-- For any sets $A$ and $B$, $A \cup B \subseteq B \cup A$. -/

  write out the definition of union in both the assumption `{h}` and the goal."

Conclusion
"
You'll be able to use the theorem `union_subset_swap` in the next level to prove
that union is commutative.
